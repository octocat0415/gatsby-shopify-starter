  Gatsby Shopify starter
</h1>

Kick off your next, ecommerce experience with this Gatsby starter. It is based on the default Gatsby starter to be easily modifiable.

This starter also includes credentials to a Shopify demo store so you can try it out immediately without having to start a store. To use your own just change the values inside of `.env`.

## ðŸš€ Quick start

1.  **Create a Gatsby site.**

    Use the Gatsby CLI to create a new site, specifying the default starter.

    ```sh
    # create a new Gatsby site using this starter
    npx gatsby new my-shopify-store https://github.com/AlexanderProd/gatsby-shopify-starter
    ```

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into your new siteâ€™s directory and start it up.

    ```sh
    cd my-shopify-store/
    gatsby develop
    ```

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-shopify-store` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!

1. **Connect your own Shopify store.**

    Open both `.env` files located in the root directory of your page end replace the credentials with your own. Don't forget to restart Gatsby for your store to be loaded!
